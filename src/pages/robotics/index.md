## Robotics

Robotics is about the systems that make up robots. 

### Overview

There are a multitude of varieties of robot types and component systems.
Each robot usually is dedicated to a set of processes with clear objectives.
A robot consists of "tools" that it uses to accomplish processes, and some kind of control system to manipulate the tools.
The three laws of Robotics, as first formulated by science fiction writer Issac Asimov, are as follows:
1. A robot may not harm or injure a human being through action or let harm happen to a human being through inaction.
2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings provided it does not violate the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, provided it does not violate the first and second laws.
